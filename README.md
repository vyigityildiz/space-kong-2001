# PROJECT â€“ PART 2

The objective of the second part of the project is to write a design report and write/modify the code of the game taking into consideration your feedbacks from the analysis meeting.
You need to update your class and use-case diagrams accordingly, and submit a report (with all necessary diagrams) and a code compatible with each other. The code you develop in this part should include all class and function declarations modeled in your designs.

You will submit an updated report which includes:  

- Proper title info with a list of group members and the name of the game
- A contents page
- A detailed description of the game
- An updated and expanded version of the class diagram drawn using draw.io
  - Explanation of the classes and relations among them.
  - Do not forget to include relation cardinalities, directions, and roles.
  - You must use Association / Aggregation and Inheritance relations; you can use Composition releation, but it is not necessary.
- Use-case diagram drawn using draw.io
  - Detailed explanation of the use-cases.
- Collaboration diagrams drawn using draw.io. You need to draw _at least one_ diagram for each use-case of your game. You may need additional collaboration diagrams to model polymorphism.
  - Explanation of the diagrams.
  - Do not forget to include proper message parameters and return types.
  - Be careful with your message numbering.

You are also expected to provide a code consisting of only declarations of classes (with necessary inheritance relationships) according to class diagrams you created. Your code and UML diagrams should match each other in all aspects. You are not expected to write the code in the functions and can put pass statements for now. Your code is not expected to perform anything, but it should be free from errors.

Submision check list: Following files are expected to be commited to the git repo.

- Code: at least one `py` file per class
- Report: one `md` file. Put pictures of your UML diagrams drawn in draw.io within the md document.
- drawio files of each UML diagram.

In your report please use good English, and spell-check before you submit. You should include references if you have any.
